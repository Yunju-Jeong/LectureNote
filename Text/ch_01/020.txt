In 1944, the MARK I, composed of mechanical and electrical components, was developed to perform simple arithmetic. And the next models such as ENIAC and UNIVAC were built. Especially, the UNIVAC was the first commercial computer used by the U.S. Census Bureau. However, the vacuum tubes used in those machines generated enormous heat that shortened the life of tubes. 
After 1960s, the technology of the computer devices developed rapidly. The next devices used for computers were transistors and Integrated Circuits (IC). Finally, the microprocessors were adopted for the various computers today.
